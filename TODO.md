# Voter Management Fix Tasks

## Current Status
- [x] Analyze the issue: Views are standalone HTML pages not using Laravel's layout system
- [x] Plan approved: Refactor views to extend app layout and use proper Blade syntax

## Tasks to Complete
- [ ] Refactor voter-management.blade.php to extend app layout
- [ ] Refactor voter-detail.blade.php to extend app layout  
- [ ] Refactor voter-edit.blade.php to extend app layout
- [ ] Check for missing views (voter-create.blade.php)
- [ ] Test functionality after refactoring

## Notes
- Ensure proper integration with Laravel's authentication and session handling
- Maintain all existing functionality while using proper Blade templating
- Use consistent styling that works with Laravel's layout system
